	h2 Getting to Orlando

	p We looked into group travel and all quotes provided from travel agencies and major airlines were $700+ for the flight alone. We thought this is too much and that booking flights separately will be cheaper. 

	h3 Catching a flight to Orlando:
	ul	
		li Fly from Winnipeg to Orlando, usually with one stopover, location depends on the airline
		li Drive to Grand Forks or Fargo and fly via Allegiant Air (Destination: Sanford, FL  - 30 miles from Orlando) 

	p Here are some links to airlines and travel sites.
